Dear friend,\n
If I haven't already told you, I trust you a lot, and I value your wisdom a lot too.\n
These times might be a little trying on me. It'd help if I had some support. I'd love for you to check in on me once in a while.\n
Vi is a little experimental service that emails you once a week to remind you to do just that.\n
Would you help me in this way, please?\n
You can find out more about Vi here: LINK.\n
Sign up with this link and you'll be added to my support group: LINK.\n
Feel free to call/text me and I'll confirm this personally.\n
Thank you. :)\n
Sincerely,\n
Your dearest friend`;
