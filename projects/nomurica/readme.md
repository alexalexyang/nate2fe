## What is this?

This app bans movies made in the USA, the UK, and China. It then finds a bunch of films from around the rest of the world.

Originally it was meant to surface films from the Global South in order to mitigate the cultural hegemony of the US and other countries for which we possess too much of a romantic notion. But I decided to leave those other first world countries in... for now.

Work in progress.

## How to use

Click the "Get Movies" button and wait. Every time you click you get more movies.
